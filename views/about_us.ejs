                        <p>Founded in 2024, ShareLyft started with a simple idea: making long journeys more enjoyable
                            and
                            cost-effective by linking drivers with passengers.</p>
                        <p>We believe in shared journeys to create memorable experiences, reduce travel costs, and
                            promote
                            eco-friendly transportation.</p>
                        <p>Safe travels, and thanks for being a part of our journey!</p>
